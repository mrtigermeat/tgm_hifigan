tgm_hifigan is a fine-tuned nsf-hifigan vocoder. It was fine-tuned off of OpenVPI's "nsf_hifigan_44.1k_hop512_128bin_2024.02" vocoder.

This vocoder was fine-tuned off of 84 hours of Singing, Speech, Rap and Stringed data. Please see the "xlsx" file to understand the breakdown of data in this vocoder.

It has been tested with voices included and excluded from the corpus used to train it, and has shown to improve the rendering quality of many voices.

The license is included in this folder, but simply put, you may:

- Use this vocoder on any DiffSinger voice library, so long as it does not break that voices individual TOS.
- Distribute this vocoder with your DiffSinger library for non-commercial use. If you would like to be able to use it for commercial uses, please email me at tora@tora-ouji.com or DM me on discord (@tigermeat). If distributed, there must be some type of acknowledgement in the voices credits.

You may not:

- Claim this vocoder as your own
- Distribute under a different name
